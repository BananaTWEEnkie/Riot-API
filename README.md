# Riot-API

Found the Riot API Challange 2.0 as it was about to end, but wanted to use it as a learning tool even if I didn't finish by the deadline.

I worked with Riot's API by obtaining match ids from the given json files(from the Riot Challange 2.0: AP item change), then used it in a url to grab data from Riot servers. there, I split up the information to grab item ids and filter it to find ap items only. As time went on, I realize from time to time the server would "time out" on the server end, returning a 500 reponse code in which the program would terminat. As a result, I started to also store all the data grabbed and filter it to be put as JSON files on my computer to be more efficient.

This is my first time learning about API, JSON files, and front-end programming. I would say this was a tough but wonderful learning experience that proved to be beneficial.
